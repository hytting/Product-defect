This repository contains code and related documents for the Classification Product Defects paper.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

1. Version of software:

- Anaconda version: 2.3.1

- Python version: 3.7.15

- CUDA version: 11.0.167

2. Related packages and their version information are contained in libs.txt.


## Code

The Product_defects_notebook.ipynb file presents the whole pipeline of this project. 

The whole process includes the following components:
1. Data preprocessing
2. Model training (loading, fine-tuning, and validation)
3. Explanation of model result 


## Model

Two models/model's weight are saved [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wqiBd_-5pn3tRm5W27kZlB9wztk41F5U?usp=drive_link):
1. Bert-based fine-tuning model: [MedDefects-BERT](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AI7sttjr67IcwaFA0Z0XHyA8BnSCAOej?usp=drive_link)
2. Weight of Bert-based join-tuning model: [MedDefects-DPT-BERT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bm-D33-vFT0ArKTxsF1hXAsLXDaXNX-U/view?usp=drive_link)
