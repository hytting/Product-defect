This is the official repository for the paper "Classification of health product defects by deep learning".

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

1. Version of software:

- Anaconda version: 2.3.1

- Python version: 3.7.15

- CUDA version: 11.0.167

2. The packages, dependencis, and version information required to run the provided notebook are included in requirements.txt file.


## Code

The Product_defects_notebook.ipynb file contains the full pipeline of this study. 

The pipeline includes the following components:
1. Data preprocessing
2. Model training (loading, fine-tuning, and prompt-tuning)
3. Model evaluation
4. Interpretability analyses
5. Performance analyses 


## Model

Two models weights are saved [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wqiBd_-5pn3tRm5W27kZlB9wztk41F5U?usp=drive_link):
1. Bert-based fine-tuning model: [MedDefects-BERT](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AI7sttjr67IcwaFA0Z0XHyA8BnSCAOej?usp=drive_link)
2. Weight of Bert-based join-tuning model: [MedDefects-DPT-BERT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bm-D33-vFT0ArKTxsF1hXAsLXDaXNX-U/view?usp=drive_link)

The models weights are stored in Google Drive and can be accessed with the following credentials:

username: med.product.defect@gmail.com
password: dna1234!@

## Demo for testing

A demo script will be provided in this repository by 15 Sep 2023.
